<h1 align="center">hi im cuda_ the cuda</h1>
<h3 align="center">a random guy who likes c# modding</h3>
<p align="center">2 years ago i believe i got my first desktop (i had 2 laptops within my life) and it took me a while to realize i could run steamvr on it (my laptops could NOT run any form of vr without crashing or getting -2 fps) and thats how i began modding vr games</p>
<p align="center">i mainly mod vr games specifically because it was one of my first forms of creating hacks/mods by myself. (with reference from others of course. not skidding)</p>
